Learn Object Oriented Programming

## [WIP]


## Constructor
Initialization of an object is guaranteed by providing a special function called the constructor. 
 
If a class has a constructor, the compiler (or runtime environment for JS people) automatically calls the constructor at the point an object is created.

The constructor call is performed automatically (abstracted away) from the end-programmer; it is performed by
the compiler at the point the object is defined.
